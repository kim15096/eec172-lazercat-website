<div class="abstract-title"><h2>Description</h2></div>
LazerCat is an innovative toy designed for cat owners, enabling them to
interact with their pets remotely through a controlled laser pointer and
live video feed. Utilizing AWS WebRTC and IoT for seamless cloud
integration, the system consists of three main components: a home-based
CC3200 module, an away CC3200 module, and a Raspberry Pi. The home
module manages local motion detection and AWS-triggered laser control,
while the away module allows users to send commands via an IR remote,
displaying these commands on an OLED screen and forwarding them to AWS.
The Raspberry Pi handles video streaming, activating upon motion
detection or user request to provide live footage of the cat activities.
Implementation goals range from basic laser activation and motion sensor
functionality to advanced features like pre-programmed laser routines,
sound playback, and real-time video streaming. The project aims to keep
cats entertained and active, providing peace of mind to owners.

    <div style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;flex:1 0 400px; margin-top: 40px;">
    This project is comprised of three core systems, each playing a crucial role in the overall functionality and integration of the system. These systems include the Away Device, the Central System, and the Home Station. Each system incorporates distinct components and functionalities, which collectively ensure seamless operation and user interaction.

<h3 id="away-device">Away Device</h3>
<p>The Away Device is designed to be with the user at all times. It
comprises the CC3200 microcontroller and a remote control. The CC3200, a
powerful and versatile microcontroller, facilitates wireless
communication and control. The remote control provides the user with the
capability to interact with and manage the system from a distance,
ensuring convenience and flexibility in operation. The user can also
select and cancel lazer modes through the deployed front-end
website.</p>
<h3 id="central-system">Central System</h3>
<p>The Central System is powered by AWS and serves as the backbone of
connectivity and data management. AWS enables the monitoring and
updating of the IoT device, providing robust and reliable cloud-based
services essential for real-time data processing and device management.
In conjunction with AWS, the project's website acts as a comprehensive
interface. The website not only provides a user-friendly platform for
interacting with the system but also complements the OLED screen by
offering additional control and monitoring capabilities. Moreover, the
website facilitates near real-time streaming of camera footage from the
Home System, enhancing the user's ability to remotely monitor and
interact with their environment.</p>
<h3 id="home-station">Home Station</h3>
<p>The Home Station is centered around a Raspberry Pi, which is
responsible for controlling various functionalities including laser game
modes, motion detection messaging, and video streaming. This system is
critical for executing the interactive features of the project. The
Raspberry Pi manages the laser game modes, allowing for different
configurations and user-controlled activities. It also handles motion
detection, sending alerts and messages based on detected movements.
Additionally, the Raspberry Pi streams video footage, which is crucial
for real-time monitoring and interaction.</p>
<p>The integration and coordination of these three systems involve the
interaction of several Finite State Machines (FSMs). The complexity of
managing multiple FSMs to ensure seamless communication and
functionality across the Away, Central, and Home Systems posed
significant challenges. These FSMs are responsible for maintaining the
state and behavior of each component, ensuring they respond
appropriately to user inputs and system events.</p>

<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<p>The final project presented numerous challenges, primarily due to the
complexity of integrating a custom web server with AWS IoT and AWS
WebRTC to function seamlessly together. The logistics of combining these
components were particularly daunting, requiring extensive
troubleshooting and fine-tuning to ensure they worked harmoniously.</p>
<p>Implementing live streaming with AWS Kinesis WebRTC was notably
difficult, especially since it was our first attempt. Initially, we
focused on using a computer camera as the master device. Once we managed
to get this working, we transitioned to implementing it on a Raspberry
Pi, which introduced new challenges. Ensuring minimal delay and
acceptable resolution was critical. Additionally, configuring the
Raspberry Pi to work with the PiCam required dealing with outdated
versions and setting GStreamer parameters for optimal performance.</p>
<p>Another significant challenge was setting the Raspberry Pi to run the
necessary Python script on boot for a plug-and-play experience. This
task involved resolving numerous issues, which we eventually overcame
using cron jobs to automate the process. This was essential for the
smooth operation of our project.</p>
<p>A major challenge was selecting the appropriate libraries and SDKs
for the custom web server to detect updates to the device shadow.
Instead of using polling GET requests, we successfully implemented a
solution using MQTT topics and subscriptions. This approach required a
deep understanding of MQTT protocols and AWS IoT functionalities, making
it a complex but rewarding task.</p>
<p>An attempt was made to implement a manual laser mode using real-time
updates from a TV remote. However, this approach was unsuccessful due to
inherent delays in motor responses to inputs, which could not be
mitigated. Despite this, we learned valuable lessons about the
limitations of the hardware we were using.</p>
<p>Overall, the project involved overcoming a series of complex
technical challenges. Despite the difficulties, we were able to find
solutions for most of the issues, resulting in a functional and
integrated system. The experience has been incredibly educational,
highlighting the importance of persistence and problem-solving in
tackling sophisticated technical projects.</p>
<h1 id="future-work">Future Work</h1>
<p>Due to the limitations of the motors, we were unable to fully
implement the manual control mode of the laser. The inherent delays in
motor responses prevented the system from achieving the desired
real-time control. To overcome this, future work will focus on
minimizing stream delay to enhance the responsiveness of the manual
control system. This could involve optimizing the current setup or
exploring alternative hardware solutions that offer faster response
times. Additionally, improving the control algorithms to ensure smoother
and more precise movements will be a priority. These enhancements will
make the manual control mode more reliable and user-friendly.</p>
<p>Another significant area for future development is the implementation
of an advanced laser mode that moves in random speeds and directions.
This feature would add a dynamic and unpredictable element to the
system, increasing its versatility and potential applications.
Developing this mode will require sophisticated algorithms that can
generate random patterns while ensuring the laser moves safely and
effectively within its operational environment. The integration of
sensors to monitor the laser's position and adjust its movement in
real-time could further enhance this feature.</p>
<p>To support these improvements, further work will also involve
optimizing the live streaming capabilities to reduce latency. Achieving
minimal stream delay is crucial for both the manual control and the new
random movement mode. This might include fine-tuning the AWS Kinesis
WebRTC settings, upgrading network infrastructure, or adopting more
efficient video compression techniques.</p>
